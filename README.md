# godot-base-template
This project is a template, nearly blank to use it as a base of new projects, it contains a settings file with autoload project settings on first start, and a keymap that could be altered and as well changed in game. If not using this template directly, make sure that at least the settings are autoloaded
Credit goes out to Heartbeast for the Idea of Setting the Project settings via code, his video gave me the idea for this template project
